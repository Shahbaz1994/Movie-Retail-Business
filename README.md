# Movie Retail Business Acquisition Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of a movie retail business, aiming to provide actionable insights for a potential acquisition. Leveraging MySQL, the analysis covers various aspects of the business, including store management, film inventory, customer demographics, and financial metrics.

## Situation

## Objective
The objective is to answer detailed queries from a prospective buyer interested in acquiring the movie retail business. Each question necessitates the crafting of intricate multi-table SQL queries, involving the joining of various tables to extract comprehensive insights.

## What We Do
- Analyze store management details, providing managers' names along with full property addresses.
- Summarize movie inventory across stores, showcasing diversity in ratings.
- Compile a detailed list of stocked inventory items, including film names, ratings, rental rates, and replacement costs.

- Provide a comprehensive list of customer names, their store affiliations, and current activity status.
- Present a unified table of board advisors and investors, including their roles and affiliations.
- Detail customer spending patterns, identifying the most valuable customers.
